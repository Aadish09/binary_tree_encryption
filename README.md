# Binary Tree Encryption

A new data encryption and decryption method is proposed using ASCII values of characters in the
plaintext and Binary Tree Traversal (BTT). First level encryption uses ASCII values of the plaintext characters
to achieve substitution. Then, the binary tree traversal is used as the second level of encryption for achieving
permutation.
